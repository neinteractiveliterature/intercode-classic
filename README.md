# Intercode Classic

Intercode is a web application that:

* serves as the public-facing web site for a convention
* automates signup and payment
* automates business processes for the convention staff

This is the original version of Intercode, which was written in PHP by Barry Tannenbaum for Intercon New England, and has 
since been used by several other conventions around the world.

[Intercode 2](https://github.com/neinteractiveliterature/intercode) is a ground-up rewrite of Intercode, making it more 
robust, more flexible, and more modern.
