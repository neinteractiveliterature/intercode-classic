<H2>Intercon Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<H3>What is LARP?</H3>
<P><b>LARP</b> stands for <b>L</b>ive <b>A</b>ction <b>R</b>ole <b>P</b>laying.
That's what most LARPers will agree on. It is interactive improvisation,
between people who are each playing a persona. After that, ask ten different
LARPers what they think LARP is, and you may get twelve or thirteen different
answers!
<P>That's because there are all sorts of games and players. LARP is not
solely
medieval fantasy games, or dark games filled with vampires, or mysteries
where
everyone tries to find out who did it, or games where people wear armor and
beat
on each other with padded weapons, or...
<P>LARP is all of these, and more.
<P>There are some things in common amongst all of these games. Everyone at
the
game comes in character. You play a role, like the Russian ambassador to
Germany, the drummer from the band <I>Toxic Waste</I>, or the doctor on
board a
luxury starliner. For the duration of the game, you dress, speak, act and
live
the part. You've got an agenda for the game - a list of things that you must
accomplish. Some tasks are easy, some things are hard. Some players may be
working towards the same goals as you, while others may be working against
you.
<P>There's no script. You improvise all your lines. You don't operate in a
vacuum, because you have a character description, a background history of
who
you're trying to be.
<P>You're also not alone. Games can be small, with only a few characters,
they
can be large, with upwards of sixty or seventy players, or they can be huge.
Games can last a few minutes, four, six, or eight hours, an entire weekend,
or even longer, played in several sessions. A good LARP can be an amazing
experience and incredibly fun to play.

<p><b>Why LARP?</b>
<p>Because it's fun! People roleplay for a whole number of reasons.
Some for escapism because it's lots of fun to be someone else for a few
hours or a few days at a time, for the social aspects of the game and the
opportunity to meet new people and for the pure exhilaration of letting your
mind run wild in a world of complete fantasy. Some players of LC style games
like the opportunity to get away from their desks and do something physical
in the fresh air.

<p><b>I play tabletop role playing games, is this similar?</b>
<p>Yes, there are many similarities, but there are also many differences.
In a tabletop game you describe what your character is doing, but in a
Live Action game you do the actions your character does.

<P>There's also a general <A href="http://www.matalics.org/lrp/larp.htm"
target=_blank>FAQ</A> from the rec.games.frp.live-action newsgroup.

<H3>What is Intercon?</H3>
Intercon is the biggest all-LARP convention in the New England area.  It is
run by <a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org">New
England Interactive Literature</a>,
an organization that exists to promote live action roleplaying in New England and beyond.

<h3>How do I sign up for games at Intercon?</h3>
<p>Intercon lets you sign up for games before the convention.  Since games have limited space, our goal with this process is to allow as many people as possible to play in the games they prefer.</p>
<p>Game signup is separate from convention registration. By registering and paying for Intercon, you are entitled to sign up for as many games as you like, provided they are not running concurrently.</p>
<p>Individual game signups usually begin in November, but will be announced in the email newsletter which is sent to everyone who has registered. You must be paid up in order to sign up for a game.</p>
<p>There are usually three or four rounds of signups, although the individual number may vary from year to year. Signups usually open at 7pm Eastern; each round is six days later than the last.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the first round, you may sign up for one game</li>
	<li>In the second, a second game</li>
	<li>(Optional) In the third round, you may sign up for a third game</li>
	<li>In the final round, you may sign up for as many games as you like</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some popular games</strong> fill within minutes. There will almost always be something you can play in any given slot--at Intercon N we had 17 games running on Saturday afternoon alone--but <strong>if you are eager to get into a certain game, prioritize it as your first signup.</strong></p>
<p>The best way to find out when signups open is to <a href="index.php?action=5">register</a>, which will add you to the Intercon newsletter. You do not need to pay for the convention at registration time (although you will need to before signing up for games).</p>

<H3>I have heard of other Intercons, what's the deal with that?</h3>
<p>You may have heard of Intercons such as Intercon Mid-Atlantic, and
Intercon NorthEasts, and even Intercons with numbers after them.  Those are
Intercons that happened outside the New England area.  They were loads of
fun, but sadly, all of them are currently defunct.


<H3>Who runs Intercon?</H3>
<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Master Blaster runs Intercon.</p>
<P>That depends on where Intercon is run. There's currently just one group
running Intercons:

<H3>Where do you find all these great games? Can I run my game at
Intercon?</H3>
<P>The con staff knows a lot of writers. We get references from players who
come
to the con. We also look for new games and new writers. So, yes, if you have
a
game, we're interested. There's an easy <A
href="Static.php?page=biddingAGame">bid
process</A>.

<H3>How do I get involved?</H3>
<P>Volunteering is <A href="Static.php?page=volunteering">easy and fun</A>.
You don't need
any experience, just a willingness to pitch in. There are jobs that need to
be
done before, during and after the con; by sharing the work, we all get a
chance
to enjoy the con.

<H3>Who is New England Interactive Literature (NEIL)?</H3>
<P><A href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org">New England Interactive
Literature</A> (NEIL) is the
group of volunteers that brings you the New England Intercons.
<H3>Who is LARPA?</H3>
<P>The Live Action RolePlayers Association (LARPA) owns the Intercon
trademark.
