<h3><i><A name=intercon>What is Intercon? Why would I want to run a game
there?</a></i></h3>
<p>
Intercon is the premiere LARP convention, running games of as many different
and varied genres as we can find. Intercon attracts LARPers and LARP writers
from all around the world. We're the largest multi-genre LARP convention in the
world.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3><i><A name=audience>What kind of LARPers come to Intercon?</a></i></h3>
<p>We
get a very diverse crowd of LARPers. For some, this is their first experience
with LARPs. For others, they've been playing games for decades. Some have been
writing games for that long.
<P>We get some great LARPers. Generally, they're looking for games with strong
characterization, with lots of plot and great storylines. These are people who
aren't just looking to stand around and wait for the GM to direct the action.
These are players that want to create memorable scenes, dramatic or comedic.
They want to immerse themselves in their roles. Many of these players like to
costume to the hilt. It's not an easy group to write for, because they have a
lot of gaming experience, but the results can be very satisfying.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->

<H3><I><A name=gameKind>What kind of LARPs are you looking for?</A></I></H3>
<p>
All kinds. Light, dark, serious, silly, short, or long, we need a mix of
games for the convention. We're looking for murder mysteries, science fiction,
high fantasy, historical set pieces, theater style, live combat, and just about
any other genre you could name. We're looking for something that isn't already
on our schedule, and we're willing to run experimental games, too.
<P>Ask ten LARPers what LARP is about and you'll get thirteen different answers.
We're trying to find interesting games that satisfy as many of those
possibilities as we can.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=notJustNew>Are you only looking for new games?</A></I></H3>
<P>No. If you have a game that's been run successfully before, we're interested.
Some of our favorite games have run many times, at other Intercons, privately,
or both.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=conTheme>Does my game have to fit into the con theme?</A></I></H3>
<P>No. Every year, the con comes up with a marketing theme or two.  Intercon&nbsp;D
had a theme of <i>deja vu</i>. Intercon&nbsp;C &quot;celebrated a century of LARP&quot;,
Intercon&nbsp;B had a theme of &quot;B movies&quot;, and so on.  We use this theme in
our advertising.  If your game fits into the theme naturally, that's great!
We may try to use it specially in our advertising.  If your game doesn't
fit the theme, it will not factor into our decision processes.  We look
at all games on their own merits.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=newAuthors>What if I've never written a game before?</A></I></H3>
<P>Intercon encourages new writers to bid games. While many of the names on the
schedule may be familiar, there are always new authors as well. We look for new
writers, because we know what's involved in the process. We know that those
familiar writers had to start somewhere. Having a great group of players to play
in the game also helps new games succeed.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=gameSize>What size games are you looking for?</A></I></H3>
<P>We are looking for games of different sizes, all as part of the mix. We've
had games as small as 4 players and as large as 50+ players. Most of the games
at the con range from 20 to 40 players. Some games have fixed sizes.
(<I>e.g.&nbsp;</I>a game needs 24 players) Some games are more flexible.
(<I>e.g.&nbsp;</I>a game can take from 20 to 30 players.) <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=smallGames>Are you really interested in small games?</A></I></H3>
<P>Sure. We've run games for four and six players before. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=bigGames>Are you interested in really big games?</A></I></H3>
<P>That depends on your definition of big. The Boston Intercons typically
attract more than 200 people, all looking for an intense experience. That
typically means they are looking for a more intimate game experience. Games of
20 to 40 people generally do very well. Because we always have a great selection
of games, players have tough choices to make when signing up. There's a lot of
competition in every time slot. We try to do our best to make all of the games
successful, but it can be difficult for games needing more than 40 players to
get enough players. 
<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=gameLength>What length games are you looking for?</A></I></H3>
<P>We're looking for games that run from five minutes to those that run all
weekend long. 
<!------------------------------------------------------------------>
<H3><I><A name=playerAges>How old are players at Intercon?</A></I></H3>
<P>
We have players as young as 8 who play games at Intercon.  We ask that all games 
list their age restrictions in the game description, both to avoid signups by 
players who are too young for the content in your game and to help young players 
and their guardians in finding appropriate games to play.
</p>
<H3><I><A name=scheduling>How do you schedule games at the con?</A></I></H3>
<P>There are seven primary time slots used to schedule games. We try to schedule
games to give the most choices to the players.

<P>The bid form asks you to rank the slots you'd prefer for running your game.
We try our best to give you your preferred slot, but it isn't always possible.
Scheduling the con is always an interesting puzzle. The more flexible you are
and the more choices you give us for scheduling makes it easier for us to put
that puzzle together.
<P>We also have to consider the time and effort that are needed to tear down a
game and set up the next one. Some games require significant setup, and the time
for that setup has to be factored into the schedule. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=fourHourSlots>Do I have to write a four hour game, to fit into
your schedule slots?</A></I></H3>
<P>No. It's true that most of our game slots are four hours long. While it helps
if your game fits nicely into one of our slots, it's not absolutely necessary.
Most successful Intercon games fit into a single slot.
<P>Two hour games are quite common. Clearly two of them fit nicely into a four
hour slot. We try to pack slots, again to maximize player options.
<P>Games up to about six hours can fit into the Friday and Saturday night slots.
Friday games may be able to run even later, stretching to seven hours, if the
players are willing to stay up.
<P>Games that are even longer must span more than one slot. Intercon will
schedule a <I>strong</I> game across more than one slot. However, if a game
spans just two slots, it means that game must compete for players with as many
as <I>ten to fourteen</I> other games. We always schedule a lot of great games
opposite each other. That means players must choose between playing in a
multislot game or in two (or more) single slot games. It takes a special game
and special writers to meet that challenge. We want the games at the con to be a
success, able to attract the number of players they need. It's why we encourage
games that fit into a single slot. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=gameSpace>What kind of space can I get for my game at a
hotel?</A></I></H3>
<P>The Crowne Plaza has <A HREF="Static.php?page=HotelLayout" TARGET=_blank>great function space</A>, and we take it all. We also
fill it up. <I>We can typically guarantee one function space room per game</I>.
If you need more than that, we may be able to make it work, depending on the
size of your game. This does limit us, but we encourage GMs to think creatively,
as we know you can.
<P>We also need to know what special spatial needs you may have beyond enough
room for your players. This includes things like a need for high ceilings,
making sure that any delicate furniture is out of the way, the desire for a
small secondary room for side activities, or specific traffic flow demands.
We'll do what we can to give you a workable space. However, be aware that we do
fill up all the function space in the hotel, and you have to share with six or
seven other games. It may not be physically possible to give you the ideal
space. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=BYOCGames>What about "Bring Your Own Character" (BYOC) games, or
games where characters are built at the door?</A></I></H3>
<P>Players come to Intercon to LARP, often playing five or six games in the span
of the weekend. This doesn't leave a lot of time for sitting with a GM to build
a character before a game. Players at Intercon typically want characters with a
rich background, interrelationships with other characters, and plots that
connect them to others. That's much harder to do with BYOC or characters built
at the door.
<P>This doesn't mean that we won't accept these kinds of games - but they are
less likely to get through the bid process. One solution is to have a deadline
for character submission well before the con, so that you can take the
characters and build them into the game. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=campaignGame>I run a very successful campaign game. Can I bring
an episode of my game to the con?</A></I></H3>
<P>If you're going to bring a lot of your usual players, then sure. It's harder
asking a lot of new players to come into an existing campaign, unless you really
have something special for the episode. It has to be something that's going to
excite others, in a way that doesn't require the new players to know all sorts
of background material. The new players also have to feel like equals to those
who have been playing a long time. It's not a lot of fun to come into a game
where there is a clique of players who outclass you in every way. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=weirdGame>My game is really weird, unlike any game I've ever seen
before. Are you interested?</A></I></H3>
<P>We're always looking for interesting games. If you can sell the Proposal Committee
on the game, it's likely you'll get players, no matter how strange the game. In
fact, many players have told us that they come to Intercon just to play games
that aren't like the ones they usually play with their local group. We're
looking for unique games, and we do our best to see that they'll be successful. <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=restrictions>My game has strong and challenging themes that might
be offensive to some, or can't be played by some people because of physical
requirements, or is only for adults. Are you interested?</A></I></H3>
<P>Yes. Intercon does not discriminate. Almost all Intercon attendees are
adults, and we let them choose the games that are right for their sensibilities
and capabilities. We look for games that push the envelope. We do understand
that some game efforts are not for everyone. We try to make that clear up front
by the game descriptions you provide. There are questions in the bid form
specifically for these cases; the details are important, so please be explicit.
<P>If you have questions or concerns, please raise those concerns with the <A
href="mailto:bids@interactiveliterature.org">Proposal Coordinator</A>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->

<H3><I><A name=responsetime>How soon can I expect to hear from you?</A></I></H3>
<p>
The Proposal Chair will contact you soon if there are any questions about your game.
We will make every effort to get back to you with a decision about your within 4 weeks.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->

<H3><I><A name=acceptanceRate>Do you accept every bid you get?</A></I></H3>
<P>We accept most reasonable bids, but there are usually one or two bids that
don't make it into a given con. All game bids are <A
href="Static.php?page=bidFollowup">evaluated by the Proposal Committee</A>, using a <A
href="Static.php?page=bidFollowup#whatWeLookFor">number of criteria</A>. We try to work
with bidders to make all the bids successful, but it doesn't always happen. When
a bid fails, we try to make it clear why the bid was rejected. The most frequent
reasons a bid is rejected is because we already have a similar game scheduled,
or because a bid insists on specific time slots and the schedule is nearly full.
<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3><I><A name=notAGame>Can I propose an event that's not a game?</A></I></H3>
<P>You can. It's best to check with the <A href="mailto:bidchair@q.interconlarp.org">Proposal
Coordinator</A> or the <A href="mailto:conchair@q.interconlarp.org">Con Chair</A>
first in these cases. </P>
