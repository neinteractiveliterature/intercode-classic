            We know it may be possible to get a slightly cheaper hotel rate by booking outside the Intercon room block.  If you want to do that, we totally understand!  But we'd really appreciate it if you could reserve a room within the block, because we've made a guarantee to the hotel for a number of room nights. In addition, each room night booked reduces Intercon's function space cost, which lets us improve the convention in many ways, and helps fund the other cool LARP-related things we do.
