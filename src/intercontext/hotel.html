            We know it may be possible to get a slightly cheaper hotel rate by booking outside the Intercon room block.  If you want to do that, we totally understand!  But we'd really appreciate it if you could reserve a room within the block, because we've made a guarantee to the hotel for a number of room nights. In addition, each room night booked reduces Intercon's function space cost by $10, which lets us improve the convention in many ways, and helps fund the other cool LARP-related things we do.
