Intercon is the biggest all-LARP convention in the New England area.  It is
run by <a href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org">New

<H3>I have heard of other Intercons, what's the deal with that?</h3>
<p>You may have heard of Intercons such as Intercon Mid-Atlantic, and
Intercon NorthEasts, and even Intercons with numbers after them.  Those are
Intercons that happened outside the New England area.  They were loads of
fun, but sadly, all of them are currently defunct.

<P><A href="http://www.interactiveliterature.org">New England Interactive
Literature</A> (NEIL) is the
group of volunteers that brings you the New England Intercons.

<H3>Who is LARPA?</H3>

trademark.
