<h1>New England Intercon Convention Rules</h1>

<h2>The Most Important Rule of All</h2>
<p>
Have a good time! Have a great time! Have a grand time! Just have fun!
</p>

<h2>Do Unto Others</h2>
<p>
Treat other convention attendees and hotel guests in a generally civilized
fashion.  Abusive, insulting, intimidating, bothersome, or outwardly illegal
behavior will not be tolerated.
</p>

<h2>Do Not Freak the General Public</h2>
<p>
Remember there are non convention-going guests staying at the hotel. All
major game activity should take place in the conference area, not the hotel
area, although quiet game activity may occur inside player rooms (not in the
halls) during the day. The hotel area should be specifically considered quiet
space after 10pm, and no game activity should take place there after that time, except in hotel suites designated by the convention for certain LARPs. Players in those LARPs are encouraged to be mindful of other hotel guests and keep activity within those hotel suites.
</p>

<h2>Communicate With Your GMs</h2>
<p>
If you know in advance that you cannot make a game, please let the GMs or Operations Staff know, so that the GMs can make proper arrangements.  If you are more than 10 minutes late for a game, you may be recast at the GMs' discretion.
</p>

<h1>Convention Policies</h1>

<h2>Game Registration Policy</h2>
<p>Intercon follows a strict first come, first serve policy when it comes to game registrations.</p>

<p>The only exceptions to this policy are age-related or legal restrictions.  Some games have age restrictions due to content or boffer combat, and the GMs have worked with the Convention staff to get approval for these restrictions.  In these cases, it will be clear from the game description.</p>

<h2>Harassment Policy</h2>
<p>
Intercon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free convention experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion, or any other factor. We do not tolerate harassment of convention attendees in any form. Convention attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the convention without a refund at the discretion of the convention organizers.</p>
<p>
Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. It also includes display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of games or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, bathroom policing, and unwelcome simulated combat using realistic or non-realistic weapon props. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the convention organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the convention with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the convention Security Staff immediately. Convention Security Staff can be identified by their convention badge, which will say "Security Staff" under their name, and, if they are on duty, by an Intercon Security Staff button.</p>
<p>
Convention Security Staff will be happy to help participants contact Hotel security or local law enforcement if desired, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the convention. Security Staff will never pressure anyone into making an official report.  We value your safety, privacy, and comfort while at Intercon.</p>
<p>
Questions about this policy should be directed to conchair@q.interconlarp.org. At con, you can contact convention staff by calling the Security Staff 24-hour hotline number at 313-SAFETY-4, or by coming to the Operations desk during Ops hours, or emailing ops@q.interconlarp.org.</p>

<h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
<p>
Intercon understands that costumes sometimes include weapons, and some boffer games have simulated combat with boffer weapons, but the safety and comfort of our attendees and other occupants of the hotel must be paramount. In the context of this policy, "weapon prop" or "weapon-like prop" refers to any prop that looks like a weapon, including but not limited to swords, knives, guns, bats, clubs, claws, arrows, etc.</p>
<p>
Any realistic-looking weapon prop must be peace-bonded and not wieldable. Swords must be secured in their sheaths with string, zip-ties, or some other method that actually prevents them from being drawn. If you need help peace-bonding your weapon prop, you may bring it to Ops. If con staff concludes that your realistic-looking weapon prop cannot be peace-bonded, you will be asked to return the prop to your hotel room or vehicle and leave it there for the duration of the convention.</p>
<p>
Wieldable weapon props must be obviously fake and approved by the GMs. In games that use boffer combat, only props approved for boffer combat by the GMs may be used for this purpose. In other games, combat may be acted out as well as being simulated with non-physical methods ONLY with the explicit permission of all parties involved. Please note that explicit permission to act out a combat does not automatically imply permission to touch another player or to contact another player with your weapon prop.</p>
<p>
Outside of games, any non-realistic weapon props must either be peace-bonded or carried in a non-threatening manner (sheathed, pointed at the floor, or put away). (Realistic weapon props must be peace-bonded at all times, as detailed above).</p>
<p>
Non-prop weapons are not allowed at Intercon.</p>
<p>
No realistic-looking gun props without orange safety tips are allowed at con under any circumstances.</p>
<p>
Violation of any of these rules is grounds for immediate expulsion from the con, without refund. If you have any questions about acceptable weapon props, ask at the Operations desk or contact the Con Chair or the Operations coordinator.</p>

<h2>Violations</h2>
<p>Anyone found violating any of the above policies may be subject to ejection from Intercon without refund.  Intercon reserves the right to expel anyone for any reason, with or without warning.</p>

<h2>Withdrawing from the Con</h2>
<p>To withdraw from the Con, email the <?php withdrawal_mail('ConChair', EMAIL_CON_CHAIR); ?> and <?php withdrawal_mail('Registrar', EMAIL_REGISTRAR); ?>.</p>
<p>If you withdraw from the Con more than 30 days before the Convention you are eligible for a full refund.  Withdrawals within 30 days of the Convention are eligible for a refund or membership in next year's Con at the discretion of the ConChair.</p>

<h1>Hotel Rules</h1>

<h2>Staying at the Crowne Plaza</h2>
<p>
Each hotel room should have no more than four occupants. Sleeping in public
areas of the hotel or in the convention areas is forbidden by the hotel
management.
</p>

<h2>No Smoking in Hotel and Convention Area</h2>
<p>
Per the Board of Health, smoking is not allowed in any public area of the hotel.
If you wish to smoke, please go to a designated public smoking area (outside).
</p>

<h2>Alcohol Policy</h2>
<p>Because of the hotel's liquor license and strict Rhode Island state law, alcohol in function spaces may only be served by a bartender from the hotel. Players and GMs may not bring their own alcohol into the function space.  If a GM would like to have a real bar for their game, we can make arrangements with the hotel in advance.  There is to be no alcohol in the Con Suite.</p>

<p>Players, GMs, or Games found in violation of this policy will be asked to remove the alcohol from the function space immediately. If they do not comply, they will be asked to leave the hotel.  If the GMs opt to have a bartender, the bartender will validate that the players are of legal drinking age.</p>

<h2>Be Nice to the Site</h2>
<p>
You may only tape something to the walls if you use light masking tape
or architect's tape, which will leave no residue and will not damage
the paint. The convention has a limited amount of tape available which
it can loan to games as needed.
</p>

<h1>Contacting Staff</h1>
<p>
Please report to Security Staff, Ops Staff or the Con Chair any incident in which a
member of the convention ignores the rules of the convention stated
above. New England Interactive Literature reserves the right to revoke,
without refund, the membership of anyone for any just cause.
</p>
<p>Security staff can be contacted via the 24-hour hotline at 313-SAFETY-4. An Ops
Staff member can always be found at the Ops desk during regular Operations
hours. If the hotel observes a guest violating any of the above rules,
the hotel reserves the right to have that guest removed from the property
without refund.
</p>
<p>
New England Interactive Literature is not responsible for any lost or
stolen property.
