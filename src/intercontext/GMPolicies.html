<H3><A name=Benefits>Benefits</A></H3>
<P>
There are some benefits to being an Intercon GM (besides being a GM at the
largest multi-genre all-LARP convention in the world).

<H3><I><A name=CompedMemberships>Comped Memberships</A></I></H3>
<p>Each game gets <i>two</i> comped memberships to the convention.
These memberships can be assigned by the GM team in any manner they see fit.
These memberships are full memberships and allow the holder to sign up for
games in advance and have full access to all Intercon convention events and
resources (including Con Suite food) for the weekend.</p>
<p>Intercon runs on a tight budget and while we'd like to comp every GM, it
is not financially possible for us to provide more than two comped full
memberships for each game. If you have additional GMs for your game that wish
to enjoy the rest of the Intercon convention, they will have to purchase full
memberships to the convention.</p>
<H3><I><A name=Advertising>Advertising</A></I></H3>
<P>We make a concerted effort to get word about all of our games out as far and
as wide as we can. Your game is part of that advertising. If you have specific
advertising material, please make sure our <A
href="mailto:outreach@interactiveliterature.org">Outreach Coordinator</A> has copies, so
that we can distribute it wherever we go.
<P>Word of mouth is the most powerful tool we have in promoting Intercon, and
our GMs are our best promoters. We'd appreciate your help in getting players to
register for your game, and for others. The Con Committee always works to make
sure that Intercon is the best all-LARP con there is, to attract players from
all around the world. With your help, we can make this the best Intercon ever.
<P>Try and encourage other folks to register now, if you can. We want to start a
positive feedback loop. The earlier we can announce a strong schedule, the more
players will be attracted to the con. That will mean we'll have to go out and
find more games, which will draw more players, and so on... If you know of
people who want to play in your game, tell them the best way to guarantee their
spot is to <I>register now</I>. That will allow them to sign up online as soon
as we open registration for your game.
<HR>

<H3><A name=Policies>Policies</A></H3>
<P>For the most part, the staff of the New England Intercon convention and the hotel are fairly lax about what you can and cannot do during the convention. There are a few rules, however, that do need to be followed. It is important to follow these policies; otherwise, the convention may not be welcomed back to the hotel. Other policies exist to ensure that everyone enjoys the convention.
<H3><I><A name=RegistrationPolicy>Game Registrations</A></I></H3>
<P>Intercon follows a strict first come, first serve policy when it comes to
game registrations. If there is someone who <I>must</I> be in your game, the
best solution is to have them sign up early, to make sure they get in.
Alternatively, you have the option of making them a GM for your game.
<P>We recognize the fact that there are players out there that may be difficult
to deal with. However, we cannot and do not discriminate. If a player signs up
for your game, we expect that you will do your best to give them a part that is
appropriate.
<P>We understand that your game may have certain restrictions that exclude certain players from participating. For example, if a game is a boffer combat game, there may be insurance reasons that require restrictions such as insurance waivers for pregnant women and players under the age of 16. Other games may deal with adult subject matter and be inappropriate for minors. If there is such a restriction, we expect that you will make it clear in your Bid Form and game description. If there is an conflict with someone who has signed up for your game violating the restrictions on it, please work with the GM Liaison to modify any game registrations.
<P>
We understand that your game may be tightly plotted or depend on pre-convention communication from the players who have signed up for the game. In these cases, non-responsive players can be troubling for your plans to ensure that everyone in your game has a great time. Start early and reach out to your players well before the convention. If at one month prior to the convention you have made a good faith effort to contact a player and have not received any response for over <b>four weeks</b>, please work with the GM Liaison to modify any game registrations.

<h3><i><a name=Communication>Communication</a></i></h3>
<p>We also recognize that just as GMs need to hear from their players before the convention, players also need to hear from their GMs as well. Players can become anxious when they do not hear from the GMs of the game(s) they have signed up for that seem to require advance information. The timing of any communications from you, as GMs, to your players will vary depending on the amount of information you need or want to give them, what information you need from them, how quickly your game fills, and your own readiness. However, we recommend contacting your players no later than one month before the convention. If your game does not require much advance preparation--all information is "given at the door," for example--then we expect that to be clear in the game description. We still urge you to contact the players well before the convention. Concerned players may contact you directly or through the GM Liaison.

<p>If the worst should happen and you are unable to attend the New England Intercon convention or will be unable to run the game you have bid to the convention, please contact the GM Liaison as soon as possible so that we are aware of the problem.

<h3><i><a name="NPCBadges">NPC Badges</a></i></h3>
<p>For some games, you may need to bring in some help from outside the
convention to run your event.  This could be a GM who knows the game, but is
not planning on attending Intercon, or NPCs who are only going to show up for
your event.   We ask that you attempt to fill the need from the pool of
Intercon attendees, but we understand that at times that may not be possible.</p>
<p>If you have a need for NPCs, please mention it on your bid, or send an email
to the Bid Chair (before your bid is accepted) or the GM Coordinator (after
your bid has been accepted) detailing how many NPC badges you will need, and
why.</p>
<p>The convention staff will evaluate your request, and let you know how many
NPC badges we will provide.  If there are a lot of requests in one year, we may
work with multiple GM teams to share resources where appropriate.</p>
<p>
NPC badges grant limited access to the convention.  A holder of an NPC badge
may substitute for last-minute openings in other games but may not sign
up for games in advance. A holder of an NPC badge will not have access to
Intercon provided consumables, for example the food in Consuite.  The primary
purpose of an NPC badge is to allow additional people to help your game.  If
the NPC wishes to have full access to the convention, they can pay the standard
at-the-door rate to upgrade their badge.</p>
<p>
There is no cost for NPC badges.  A list of names associated with these badges
must be provided to the GM Coordinator no later than one week before the
convention.  The NPC can pick up their convention badge at the Operations desk
from Friday evening on, and can upgrade their badge to a full badge for the
at-the-door price if they wish.</p>

<h3><i><a name=WeaponPolicy>Weapons</a></i></h3>
<p>
The hotel is very concerned about scaring the mundanes with real looking
weapons (and rightfully so). As such, they have requested that <i>any weapons
used in a game must be obvious fakes</i>. The Intercon staff recognizes that
this may not be practical for all games as tone and mood setting are very
important aspects of a LARP. If your game requires the use of weapons that could
be construed as real, we ask the following:
<ul>
<li>If at all possible, please keep all weapon props behind closed doors.
<li>If the players need to leave the function space (or travel from one function
room to another), make sure your players have blades sheathed and guns hidden.
We will be on extra alert for this given that recent current events have
hypersensitized people to any threats of violence.
<LI><I>Absolutely no combat (with fake or real-looking weapons) may take place in the
<B>public</B> hallway areas</I>. </LI>
</UL>
<P>If this policy is not strictly adhered to, the hotel has the right to expel
the player or game in question without warning. Intercon staff will issue one
warning; if this policy is violated a second time, the player and/or the game
may asked to leave.
<H3><I><A name=AlcoholPolicy>Alcohol</A></I></H3>
<P>Because of the hotel's liquor license and strict Massachusetts state law,
alcohol may only be served by a bartender from the hotel. Players and GMs may
not bring their own alcohol into the game space. If a GM would like to have a
real bar for their game, we can <A href="#BarService">make arrangements with the
hotel</A>.
<P>Players, GMs, or Games found in violation of this policy will be asked to
remove the alcohol from the game space immediately. If they do not comply, they
will be asked to leave the hotel. If you opt to have a bartender, the bartender
will card your players.
<H3><I><A name=FirePolicy>Candles or Fire</A></I></H3>
<P>Candles are allowed as long as they are contained in a glass holder that is
at least as tall as the flame.
<H3><I><A name=WallHangingPolicy>Wall Hangings</A></I></H3>
<P>
You may hang things on the wall provided you use painter's tape (the blue stuff). Intercon Ops may have a small amount of approved tape on hand, but it is recommended that you bring your own supply.
<HR>

<H3><A name=Services>Services</A></H3>
<P>There are several services that the con can provide for your game. There are
other services that we can arrange with the hotel.
<P><I>NOTE: all prices quoted here are as of 2003, and are subject to
change.</I>
<H3><I><A name=SpaceService>Game Space</A></I></H3>
<P>Intercon rents all the conference space available in the hotel. We encourage
you to review the <A HREF="Static.php?page=HotelLayout" TARGET=_blank>conference space layout</A>.
<P>It is important that you let us know your space requirements as soon as you
understand those requirements. We cannot guarantee that you will receive the
room(s) that you request. We need to know your sense of space requirements in
general; we will do our best to give you the best possible game space. However,
we have to fit all of the games at the con in your timeslot(s), which may mean
some creativity in meeting your space needs. Final space assignments are
probably not possible until a month or so before the convention.
<H3><I><A name=FurnitureService>Tables, Chairs and Furniture</A></I></H3>
<P>The hotel has the following furniture available:

<H3><I><A name=FoodService>Food</A></I></H3>
<P>The contract we have with the hotel grants them the exclusive right to cater
events.  Event organizers are not allowed to serve outside food or drinks to
their attendees.  If you wish to serve food or drinks, the hotel will happily
cater your event for a fee.
<P>The hotel has many standard menus ranging from
snacks to full meals. Menus start around $4.00 per person (for snacks / very
light meals) and go up from there. The hotel is also willing to work with the
GMs to provide a specialized meal for your game.
<P>Food orders are due by mid-January in order to give us time to finalize the
menu, so, if you are considering ordering food, you must give us plenty of
advance warning. <I>Intercon cannot pay for food for your game. GMs are
responsible for payment</I>.
<H3><I><A name=BarService>Bartenders</A></I></H3>
<P>Bartenders are available from Monday through Saturday, from 11:00am to
1:00am. Costs for the bartender are $50.00 per hour; due to the state liquor
laws, you <I>must</I> provide food to go with the alcohol (at least snacks).
This will generally cost another $75.00 to $100.00. Because providing food is
not cheap, you may ask your players to make a donation to cover the costs of the
food. They are not required to pay in order to play, however. <I>Intercon cannot
pay for these items. GMs are responsible for payment</I>.

<H3><I><A name=OpsService>Intercon Ops Staff</A></I></H3>
<P>
Intercon Operations Staff are available throughout the Con to assist you. They will help you set up if time and people are available. If you need anything from the hotel staff, please contact Ops.  Ops and hotel staff will also be around during the running of your game to make sure you have water, etc.
<p>
If you know that your game may have a difficult set up or break down, let the GM Coordinator and Bid Chair know so we can schedule your game appropriately.

<H3><I><A name=HotelService>Hotel Negotiations and Arrangements</A></I></H3>
<P>
We ask that you let the Intercon Staff make the arrangements for the
equipment and food. Depending on the demands of the con, we may be able to
negotiate a lower rate for you individually. (At the very least, if we know
several people want to use a resource, the cost can be split evenly among them).
GMs will pay Intercon for the rentals and food. Payment for everything is due by
mid-February. If payment is not received by this date, the order will be
cancelled. (If more than one GM is sharing a resource, the other GM(s) will be
asked to pick up the additional cost). If you meet the deadlines stated above,
we will be able to give you a final price for the food and final equipment
rental prices no later than February 1<sup>st</sup>. If you miss the above deadlines, we cannot guarantee that you will receive your requested items.
