<h3>Iron GM Contest</h3>

<p>Are you a new LARP author who wants a push to write more? A seasoned author looking for a challenge? Or maybe an insomniac who comes up with your best crazy ideas late at night? If you answered "yes" to any of these, you might be interested in Intercon M's Iron GM competition!</p>

<p>We're taking up to four GM teams of one to four people and giving them each 24 hours to write a game based on three secret "theme" ingredients.  Previous Iron GM competitions had such ingredients as "The Illuminati, The Kaballah, and Enhanced Humans" and "drugs, fascism, and children's music." The themes will not be revealed until the 24 hours start. </p>

<p>The goal is to have a complete game that can be run by any other GM team at another convention.  The games should be 2 hours long and written for 12 people. The 24-hour game-writing portion will occur about a week before Intercon M. The finished games will be played by Intercon attendees on Sunday morning.  The games will be judged on playability, enjoyability, and integration of the themes.  The winning GM team receives a fabulous cash prize!  (Prize and judge details TBD.)</p>

<p>You can still help the Iron GM contest even if you don't want to write.  You can play in the games and help decide which team will win the cash prize! No one knows yet what the games will be like, but we do know they'll be fun!</p>
