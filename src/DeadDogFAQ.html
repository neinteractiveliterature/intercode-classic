<h2>Dead Dog FAQ and Menu</h2>

<p>Intercon is having an organized dead dog this year.</p>

<p><b>"How does it work?" I hear you cry.<super>*</super></b><br/>
<a href="DeadDog.php">Buy a ticket to dead dog on the
Intercon K website</a> much like you would buy an Intercon T-shirt.  Once
you have a ticket, you've got until 3:30 Sunday to make your way over to
<a href="http://newmotherindia.com/">New Mother India</a> on Moody Street
in Waltham.  Your ticket includes all the food you can eat and all the
soda and water you can drink.</p>

<p><b>Won't we crush their kitchen and food will take forever?</b><br/>
Nope!  It's a buffet, and the folks at New Mother India are very used to
serving up buffets of this magnitude.</p>

<p><b>I want to sit next to the people I larped with!</b><br/>
Sitting near everyone you larped with this weekend might require
non-Euclidean physics.  But the tables are long and we have the entire
restaurant to ourselves, so we can probably sort something out.</p>

<p><b>I can't eat spicy food, or meat, or anything with wheat gluten in it,
or possibly any of those things!  Also I crave lassi and don't drink
corn syrup!</b><br/>
The guy who arranged this can't stand spicy food either, so there's
something there for you.  He has friends who won't eat anything that
isn't spicy, so there's something there for them too.  Vegetarian
options abound in Indian food and NMI is no exception, <i>and</i>
they're an entirely gluten-free zone.  New Mother India's full beverage
selection (including beer and wine) will be available, but you'll be on
your own for anything past soda.</p>

<p>New Mother India is the best Indian place in Waltham, possibly in the
whole Boston area.  The owner has been extremely cooperative ever since
we approached him, and if this goes well we could do it for the next
five years.  The full menu planned for the buffet is below.  It can be
changed if there's an outcry, but it should be pleasantly balanced.</p>

<p>Tickets to this event will be transferable, but not refundable.</p>
