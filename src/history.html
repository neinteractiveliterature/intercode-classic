<H3>The History of New England Intercons</H3>
<P>Intercon has a long history, and there are <A 
href="http://www.larpaweb.net/" target=_blank>more details</A> elsewhere. 
<P>By March of 1996, a number of New England LARPers were travelling down to the 
Baltimore/Washington DC area to play in games, and to meet up at the southern 
Intercons. The idea of running a local LARP convention was raised by several 
people. There'd been a convergence of a number of LARP groups in the Boston 
area, and it seemed like critical mass was there. On Columbus Day weekend, at 
Intercon 11.5, the bid for a New England Intercon was accepted. 
<P>The first thing that was different about the New England Intercons was the 
staff. Each southern Intercon had been organized by one or two con chairs, with 
a small dedicated group of volunteers. Intercon the Thirteenth had a large group 
of volunteers, sharing the work amongst a much wider set of people. This is the 
model that we've followed ever since. 
<P>The second thing that was different was that, at the first meeting, no one 
person knew everyone else in the room. Everyone was a newcomer to someone in 
that room. Organizing a convention was a new thing, so we had to trust people we 
didn't know to do important jobs. While the original people now know each other, 
we still follow the model, letting newcomers come in and do important things for 
the con.

<P>The first New England Intercon, starting on a Friday the Thirteenth, under a 
full moon. It was ominous. It was great fun. It had five tracks of games. It was 
the largest Intercon in Intercon history at that point.

<P>Proving that Intercon the Thirteenth wasn't a fluke, XIV was the second 
largest Intercon to that point. XIV had five tracks of games, including a 
weekend long Vampire game, a P.G. Wodehouse game, and a game with the GMs in 
their own mental institution.

<P>The con moved to the Chelmsford Radisson because the Hampton Inn was just too 
small. There was an X-Files &quot;The LARP Out There&quot; theme. There were pirates, 
anti-war protesters, a Victorian skyship, and Guy Fawkes, among others.

<P>Needing a more formal charter, Intercon A was the first convention under <A 
href="Static.php?page=NEIL">NEIL</A>. With a theme of action-adventure, we didn't 
expect the adventure to be fighting through the snow to get to the con. Despite 
nearly a foot of snow, almost everyone made it to a great set of games.

<P>With a theme of B-movies for the con, you can still see some really 
outrageous B-movie costumes on the commercials for &quot;Chowdah&quot;, AT&amp;T's local 
access channel. Whether it was young wizards in love, cowboys in a strange land, 
tryouts for an outrageous band, or the return of an angry mummy, people had a 
great time.

<P>Celebrating a &quot;century of LARP&quot;, Intercon C has the most diverse set of games 
and GMs in Intercon history to date. It's surpassed Intercon the Thirteenth as 
the largest Intercon ever. With seven tracks of games, Intercon C has filled up 
the function space at the Chelmsford Radisson.
