Intercon appeals to a diverse group of players of all ages, ethnicities, 
belief systems, sexual preferences, physical capabilities and so on.  
Authors can write interesting games that might not be suitable for all 
audiences.  In order for the con staff to balance these potentially 
opposing requirements, please answer the following questions.

(A yes answer to any or all of these questions does not disqualify the bid.  
Intercon has run several great games that push these boundaries, and will 
continue to do so.)

Are there any components of your game that might offend or upset some group 
of players?  (e.g.  adult themes, potentially offensive story arcs, etc.)  
If so, please explain:



Are there any physical restrictions imposed by your game?  (e.g.  live 
boffer combat, confined sets, etc.)  If so, please explain:



Are there any components of your game that might be illegal for players 
under the age of 18?  (e.g.  props or items that are illegal for a minor to 
possess, alcohol, etc.)  If so, please explain:

<H3>How can we best schedule this game at the convention?</H3><PRE><CODE>
The con can schedule your game into one (or more) of the eight time slots 
available over the weekend.  The con has to put together a balanced 
schedule, so that we can satisfy the most players in the most time slots.  
Your flexibility in scheduling your game is vital.

Please pick your top three preferences for when you'd like to run your 
game, with 1 as your first choice, 2 as your second, and 3 as your third.  
Put an X in any time slots that you'd prefer not to run in.

   Friday               Saturday             Sunday
   
                        [ ] morning          [ ] morning
   [ ] afternoon        [ ] afternoon
   [ ] evening          [ ] evening
   [ ] after midnight   [ ] after midnight
   
If you only marked one or two time slots, is there a specific reason for 
that restriction?  Please explain:


Are there any other scheduling constraints on your game?  (e.g.  you're a 
GM for another game)


Are you willing to run the game more than once?  [ ] Yes  [ ] No

<H3>How can we best promote and advertise this game?</H3><PRE><CODE>
Main Email Address for Game Inquiries: _________________________________
URL for game website, if any:          _________________________________

Please write a high concept blurb (one brief sentence) for the game.  This 
will be used in advertising designed to sell the game to the general 
public, not generally on flyers seen by experienced LARPers, so include 
information about the genre.  For example: "Members of a Vampire Cabal 
battle for control of Schenectady" is better than "The Prince of 
Schenectady is dead, who will take his place?"



Please write a short blurb (50 words or less) for the game.  This will be 
used for advertising purposes on con flyers.  Write in an "inverted 
pyramid" style with the details you *most* want left in towards the top, 
and details that can be cut towards the bottom.  We'll use as much as we 
can fit.  Feel free to include a website or email address that people could 
go to for more information.



Please write a longer blurb (2-3 paragraphs) for the game.  This will be 
used for advertising on the con website and some flyers.  This can be an 
expanded version of your plug above.



Without giving away any secrets for the game (because we want to play in 
it), are there any additional interesting things that we can use when we do 
Shameless Plugs for the game?  Do you have a Shameless Plug or advertising 
spiel you use when you talk about the game that you can send or describe to 
us? Please explain:


Are you going to be going to any games, events, or other conventions where 
you will advertise your game for Intercon?  If so, which ones?


Would you be willing to advertise Intercon at these events, by taking 
flyers, doing plugs for the convention, or doing plugs for other games at 
Intercon?  If so, what are you willing to do and when?


Do you want us to send you Intercon flyers to distribute? [ ] Yes  [ ] No

<H3>What now?</H3>When you've completed this, please email it to 
bids@interactiveliterature.org. My email can handle email attachments, if you want to send 
it that way. Please note that I do <B>not</B> do Microsoft Word. If you send it 
to me in Word, I'm going to have to translate it first. 
<P><B>The first round of bids will end on May 15, 2003</B>, so that we can start 
plugging games on June 1st. We know that a successful con depends on having a 
strong schedule of games chosen, published and advertised as quickly as we can, 
so <B>please get your bid in as soon as possible</B>. Additional rounds of bid 
evaluation and acceptance will follow, but are not yet scheduled. 
<P>If you're considering a bid, but aren't sure, please drop me a note, so that 
I can keep you informed about upcoming rounds of bids and acceptances.
